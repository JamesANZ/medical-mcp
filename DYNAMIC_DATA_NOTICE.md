# üö® DYNAMIC DATA SOURCE NOTICE

## Medical MCP Server - No Hardcoded Data

This Medical MCP Server is designed to provide **100% dynamic medical information** by querying live medical databases and APIs. **NO hardcoded medical data is used anywhere in the system.**

## üìä Data Sources

All medical information is retrieved dynamically from these live sources:

### 1. **FDA API** (Food and Drug Administration)

- **Purpose**: Drug labeling, safety information, warnings
- **Endpoint**: `https://api.fda.gov/drug/label.json`
- **Data**: Real-time drug information, contraindications, adverse effects
- **Freshness**: Depends on FDA database updates

### 2. **PubMed API** (National Library of Medicine)

- **Purpose**: Medical literature, research articles, clinical studies
- **Endpoint**: `https://eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/`
- **Data**: Latest medical research, diagnostic criteria, treatment guidelines
- **Freshness**: Real-time as articles are published and indexed

### 3. **WHO Global Health Observatory API**

- **Purpose**: Global health statistics and indicators
- **Endpoint**: `https://apps.who.int/gho/athena/api/`
- **Data**: Population health metrics, mortality rates, disease prevalence
- **Freshness**: Updated as WHO releases new data

### 4. **RxNorm API** (National Library of Medicine)

- **Purpose**: Standardized drug nomenclature
- **Endpoint**: `https://rxnav.nlm.nih.gov/REST/`
- **Data**: Drug name standardization, clinical drug information
- **Freshness**: Updated with new drug approvals and nomenclature changes

### 5. **Google Scholar** (Web Scraping)

- **Purpose**: Academic research discovery
- **Method**: Dynamic web scraping with anti-detection measures
- **Data**: Additional research articles, citations
- **Freshness**: Real-time search results

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Warnings

### **Network Dependency**

- **REQUIRED**: Internet connectivity for all medical information
- **Impact**: System will return empty results if APIs are unavailable
- **Fallback**: No hardcoded fallback data - system fails gracefully

### **Data Freshness**

- **Variable**: Depends on source database update schedules
- **FDA**: Updated as new drugs are approved or safety alerts issued
- **PubMed**: Updated as new research is published and indexed
- **WHO**: Updated periodically with new health statistics
- **RxNorm**: Updated with new drug nomenclature

### **API Rate Limits**

- **PubMed**: 3 requests per second without API key
- **FDA**: No official rate limit, but reasonable use expected
- **WHO**: No official rate limit
- **Google Scholar**: Subject to anti-bot measures

## üîç What This Means

### **For Users:**

1. **Always Current**: Information reflects the latest available data
2. **No Stale Data**: No risk of outdated hardcoded information
3. **Comprehensive**: Access to vast medical databases
4. **Transparent**: Source of information is always disclosed

### **For Developers:**

1. **No Maintenance**: No need to update hardcoded medical data
2. **Scalable**: Can handle any medical query through live APIs
3. **Reliable**: Uses authoritative medical sources
4. **Extensible**: Easy to add new data sources

## üö® Safety Considerations

### **Data Accuracy**

- Information comes from authoritative medical sources
- However, API data may have errors or be incomplete
- Always verify critical information through multiple sources

### **Clinical Use**

- **NEVER** use this system as the sole basis for clinical decisions
- **ALWAYS** consult qualified healthcare professionals
- **ALWAYS** verify information through official medical resources

### **System Reliability**

- System performance depends on external API availability
- Network issues may cause temporary unavailability
- No offline functionality - requires internet connection

**No hardcoded data layer exists in this architecture.**

## ‚úÖ Verification

To verify this system uses no hardcoded data:

1. **Search the codebase** for any hardcoded medical information
2. **Check API calls** - all data comes from live endpoints
3. **Review error messages** - they indicate dynamic search failures, not missing hardcoded data
4. **Test offline** - system returns empty results when APIs are unavailable

## üîÑ Continuous Updates

This system automatically benefits from:

- New drug approvals (FDA)
- Latest medical research (PubMed)
- Updated health statistics (WHO)
- New drug nomenclature (RxNorm)
- Recent academic publications (Google Scholar)

**No manual updates required for medical data content.**
